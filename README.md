# LM-KBC2023
Solution entry to the ISWc 2023 challenge on Knowledge Base Construction from Pre-trained Language Models (LM-KBC)

This work present __Minimal Probe__, which predicts objects provided a subject and relation. Through this challenge, we test the limits of LLMs in zero-shot setting, when it comes to object prediction for the task of knowledge base construction.

- `baseline-GPT3x-NED.py` is an update of the GPT3 baseline provided in the challenge, using chat models.
- `baseline-SG.py` is our Minimal Probe.
